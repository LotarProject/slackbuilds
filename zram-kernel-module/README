zram is a module of the Linux kernel, previously called "compcache". zram 
increases performance by avoiding paging on disk and instead uses a compressed
block device in RAM in which paging takes place until it is necessary to use the
swap space on the hard disk drive. Since using RAM is an alternative way to
provide swapping on RAM, zram allows Linux to make more use of RAM when
swapping/paging is required, especially on older computers with less RAM
installed.

This package contain a start/stop script: /etc/rc.d/rc.zram

The rc.zram script create 1024M (1G) of swap memory by default. If you prefer
change the dimensions of the swap memory, edit the SIZE variabile.

If you need start zram at boot add the following to your /etc/rc.d/rc.local
script and make sure rc.zram has executable permissions set:

  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.zram ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.zram start
  fi
