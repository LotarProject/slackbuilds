# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

zram-kernel-module: zram (Linux Kernel Module)
zram-kernel-module:
zram-kernel-module: zram is a module of the Linux kernel, previously called "compcache".
zram-kernel-module: zram increases performance by avoiding paging on disk and instead uses
zram-kernel-module: a compressed block device in RAM in which paging takes place until it
zram-kernel-module: is necessary to use the swap space on the hard disk drive. Since using
zram-kernel-module: RAM is an alternative way to provide swapping on RAM, zram allows
zram-kernel-module: Linux to make more use of RAM when swapping/paging is required,
zram-kernel-module: especially on older computers with less RAM installed.
